                       TAME V2.0 Release Notes
                       -----------------------


- Improved performance due to a complete redesign and a lot of micro-
  optimizations.

- More and improved debug messages.

- New examples.

- New feature: For the methods "writeArray" and "writeArrayOfStruct": 
  With the parameter "item" set to the index number of an array item,
  only this item of the array is written to the PLC. So there's no need to 
  write the whole array or calculating the address of the item by yourself,
  if one want's to write one element only.

- New feature: For reading/writing structures it's now possible to define 
  arrays as a type in structures, i.e. ARRAY.20.STRING.11 for an array of 
  20 string variables, each with 11 characters length.

- New feature: Instead of defining the field "fld" and the address as a number
  in the request descriptor, the address can now be written like the address
  in the PLC: 
  
    addr: "%MB23"
    addr: "%MW100"
    addr: "%MX0.1"
    
  Although the old notation is still supported, it's deprecated and should
  not be used anymore.

- New feature: The WebServiceClient has an additonal property "language" for 
  setting the language of names of days and months, used for the formatted 
  output of dates. 
  Defaults to german (ge).

- Changed API: The name of the parameter for reading variables defined in a 
  direct sequence has changed (method "readReq").

    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    cont        seq

- Changed API: The item list of a request descriptor has to be an array now,
  the alternative use of an object literal has been removed. The name of
  the property has also changed:
  
    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    varlist     items
    
- Changed API: Renamed paramters for creating the Webservice Client:

    - Changed call: TAME.WebServiceClient.createClient

    - Changed parameter:
    
        old         new
        ----------- -----------
        url         serviceUrl
        netId       amsNetId
        port        amsPort
        dataAlignm  dataAlign4

- Changed API: For the methods "readString/writeString" and "readArrayOfString/
  writeArrayOfString" the parameter for the length of the string has changed.
  
    old         new
    ----------- ------------
    len         strlen

- Bugfix: Acknowledgement counter was broken, fixed.

- Bugfix: Upper limts for SINT, INT and DINT were wrong, fixed.
